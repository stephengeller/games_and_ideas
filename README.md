## Current project list

- gradecalculator.rb: Built to work out my grade averages throughout university. Uses multiple methods to calculate per-year averages, and can be used to tell the user what is required to achieve certain grades. Currently lacking a user interface however!
- pickanumber.rb: Simple game. Can you guess the number the computer is thinking of?
- multifunctioncomp.rb: Fully fledged game computer! Has temporary CRUD functionality, allows you to play 3 independent games (one being pickanumber) and has a user interface to travel through the program. Currently lacks support in making CRUD changes permanent however.

### Deployment

Once the directory is on your computer, all you have to do is execute the file from the terminal! For example:

```
$ ruby multifunctioncomp.rb
```



## Built With

Ruby!
